    "\n",
    "The cool files provided are at 5kb resolution. There is a trade-off when choosing a resolution for Hi-C contact maps. The higher resolution, the more details can be seen, however this also reduces the contrast, especially at longer ranges. This is visible by eye: At high resolutions, contacts quickly drop to near-zero values when going away from the diagonal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the coverage and signal we are interested in, we might need to use different resolutions. For example, short range signals like TADs or chromatin loops are analysed easily at high resolutions (e.g. 5-10kb), whereas compartments often require using lower resolutions (e.g. 50-100kb).\n",
