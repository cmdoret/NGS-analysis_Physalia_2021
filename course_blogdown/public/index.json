	"content": " Dates 11-15 January 2021\nGeneral topic: Regulatory function of chromatin\nWhere This course will be held online in response to the coronavirus outbreak.\nOverview This course will introduce biologists and bioinformaticians to the field of regulatory genomics.We will cover a broad range of software and analysis workflows that extend over the spectrum from the best practices in the quantitative analysis of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data to the analysis of the chromatin 3D structure (such as A/B compartments, chromatin loops or TADs). This course will help the attendees gain accurate insights into local and spatial regulatory functions of the chromatin.\nFormat The course is structured in modules over five days. Each day will include an brief introductory lecture of key concepts. The remainder of each day will consist in practical hands on sessions. These sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as applying these skills on your own to complete individual exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a group.\nTargeted audience and required background The course is aimed at researchers interested in learning how to extract biological insights from genomics data, such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq or Hi-C.\nIt is primarily targeting researchers who are relatively new to the field of bioinformatics, with practical experience in the experimental side of epigenomics.\nAttendees should have a background in biology as well as be familiar with genomic data and common file formats from NGS sequencing experiments (fastq, BAM, BED).\nPractical exercises will use command-line Linux, Python and R code. We will use Snakemake to ensure reproducible coding, and jupyter-notebook to generate clear interactive reports.\nWe will start by introducing general concepts of chromatin biology. From there, we will then continue to describe all major analysis steps from the raw sequencing data to the processed and usable data. Finally, we will focus more specifically on the different analyses strategies to use to extract information from genomic datasets such as Hi-C, ATAC-seq or ChIP-seq.\nLearning outcomes  Characterisation of the global 3D structures from the sequencing data Detection of regulatory interactions and quantification of their changes between conditions. Good practices to avoid confounding variables and pitfalls in the processing. Proper use of controls and normalization. Visualisations techniques and integrations of different layers of informations.  Example data  We will use data from yeast and mouse genomes for Hi-C analyses We\u0026rsquo;ll use mouse and C. elegans data for the ATAC and ChIP-seq analyses. We encourage the participants to bring, analyze (if possible) and discuss their own data  Prerequisites:  Unix command line: before the course, please go over the following tuto: \u0026hellip; Python R/Bioconductor Snakemake Jupyter  See [Program]() chapter for more information.\nInstructors Dr. Jacques Serizay Mr. Cyril Matthey-Doret\nSee [Contacts] chapter for more information.\n"
