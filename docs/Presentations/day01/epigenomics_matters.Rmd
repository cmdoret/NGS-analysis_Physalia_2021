# Epigenomics introduction

Day 1


## Regulatory function of chromatin

* Chromatin state regulates gene expression
* Use epigenomics to understand gene regulation

## Types of chromatin information

We will look at 3 scales of chromatin organization during this workshop:
* Chromosome conformation capture
* Histone marks ChIP-seq
* ATAC-seq


## A picture of the regulatory landscape

* Gene expression tells us what genes are affected during e.g. differentiation, disease...
* Epigenomics can tell us how / why they are activated
