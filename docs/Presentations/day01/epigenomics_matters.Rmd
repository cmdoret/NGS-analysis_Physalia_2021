# Epigenomics introduction

Day 1


## Regulatory function of chromatin

* Chromatin state regulates gene expression
* Use epigenomics to understand gene regulation

## Types of chromatin information

* Chromosome conformation capture
* Histone marks ChIP-seq
* ATAC-seq


## A picture of the regulatory landscape

* Gene expression tells us what genes are affected during e.g. differentiation, disease...
* Epigenetic tracks tell us how / why they are activated
