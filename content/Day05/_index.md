## Exercises for {{< param "day" >}}

-  **\[1 h\]** Annotating chromatin states from genomic assays in Yeast
    [[Rmd]](/{{<myPackageUrl>}}Exercices/{{< param "practical1" >}})

    > Data for this part of the course was collected from a variety of papers

-  **\[1 h\]** Intersecting ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq experiments:
    [[Rmd]](/{{<myPackageUrl>}}Exercices/{{< param "practical3" >}})

    > As genome-wide assays are increasingly more streamlined, 
    integrating data from multi-omics experiments becomes a challenging step.  
    Here, we will see an example of how to integrate 
    ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data together.
