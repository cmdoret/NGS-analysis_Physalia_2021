## Exercises for {{< param "day" >}}

-  **\[30 min\]** Intersecting ATAC-seq with GO databases:
    [[Rmd]](/{{<myPackageUrl>}}Exercices/{{< param "practical1" >}})

-  **\[1 h\]** Intersecting ATAC-seq with public TF motif databases:
    [[Rmd]](/{{<myPackageUrl>}}Exercices/{{< param "practical2" >}})

    > As genome-wide assays are increasingly more streamlined, 
    integrating data from multi-omics experiments becomes a challenging step.  
    Here, we will see an example of how to integrate 
    ATAC-seq with public databases such as transcription factor binding motif databases. 

-  **\[1 h 30 min\]** Inspecting chromatin states changes in Human
    [[Rmd]](/{{<myPackageUrl>}}Exercices/{{< param "practical3" >}})

    > Data for this part of the course is entirely recovered from `AnnotationHub`.
