## Exercises for {{< param "day" >}}

-  **\[1 h 30 min\]** Intersecting ATAC-seq with public databases:
    [[Rmd]](/{{<myPackageUrl>}}Exercices/{{< param "practical2" >}})

    > As genome-wide assays are increasingly more streamlined, 
    integrating data from multi-omics experiments becomes a challenging step.  
    Here, we will see an example of how to integrate 
    ATAC-seq with public databases such as transcription factor binding motif databases.
