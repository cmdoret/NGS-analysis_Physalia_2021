## Exercises for {{< param "day" >}}

- Processing Hi-C data from the start **\[45min\]** [[Rmd]](/{{<myPackageUrl>}}Exercices/day01/processing_hic.html)

    You will be working with published wild type yeast (_S. cerevisiae_) data from [Dauban, L. et al., 2020](https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(20)30040-X).

- Improving the workflow with snakemake [[Jupyter]](/{{<myPackageUrl>}}Exercices/day01/snakemake_pipeline.html)

    You will be streamlining the process from the previous exercise to make it more reproducible, easily tweak parameters or add new samples. We will be adding another dataset of yeast in M phase [Garcia-Luis, J. et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-019-0307-x) and doing basic comparisons between the conditions.
